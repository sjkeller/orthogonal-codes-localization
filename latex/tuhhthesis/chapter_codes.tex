\chapter{PN and orthogonal sequences}

There are two main goals need to be pursued for receiving higher localization accuracy.\\    
First the code which is used for the under water localization needs its auto-correlation approaching a Dirac impulse. Thus one get advantageous detection capabilities.\\
The next factor are cross-correlation properties, which should meet certain criteria for improving the separation from other sequences. These will come in handy if noise, reflections and other artifacts emerge.

\section{Pseudo-random codes}

There are a couple of principles to generate PN sequences. Most of these methods use linear feedback shift registers to generate the codes by an initial condition. In this project I will concertize my research on gold codes, Kasami-Codes and the classical m-sequences which are also used for generating gold codes.\\
M-sequences are binary PN codes, which are generated by linear shift registers with feedback. The sequences are periodic and contain the same number of zeros and ones \cite{proakis08}.

\subsection{Gold Codes}

Because of not optimal cross-correlation properties m-sequences alone are not applicable for the project. But if these type of codes are combined their correlation qualities can change. Gold Codes are m-sequences where two of them with same length are modulo-2 summed. \cite{proakis08} \\
The gold code which has the highest similarity to Gaussian random variable has a degree of 13. Thus, a generator polynomial pair of $x^13+x^4+x^3+x+1$ and $x^13+x^12+x^10+x^9+x^7+x^6+x^5+x+1$ is chosen \cite{merrifield} .

\subsection{Kasami Codes}

Kasami sequences are constructed in the same fashion by using m-sequencs. But now the second sequence which is used in the modulo sum is formed by decimating the default m-sequence by  $2^{m/2}$ \cite{proakis08}.
