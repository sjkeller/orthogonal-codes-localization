# project Orthogonal Codes for Acoustic Underwater Localization

## First Stage 06-22 to 07-22 (3h / week)

* initial familiarization with the topic
* gold codes vs pseudorandom codes vs other most used ones
* what happens if certain parameters are changed in respect to auto-correlation and cross-correlation
* orthogonal signal processing
* motivational presentation of topic and own ideas
* relation of peaks and code lengths
* relation between max num. of seeds and code length

## second stage 07-22 to 09-22 (10h / week)

* Research Orthogonal Codes and their Implementation
* Research Localisation Algorithms
* Implementation and documentation of MATLAB scripts
* Researching good Python libraries for research subject

CURRENT TODOS:

* remove mean plot wont matter anyway
* 100ms per whole sequence and round about 1ms for a bit
* using multiple plots for correlation coeffincent 
* bandwith and data rate (read pulse shaping tech paper)
* max bandwith mode: 25khz simulator 20khz

## third stage 09-22 to 12-22 (20h / week)

* IMU for better position approximation while using EKM
* Implementation and documentation of python scripts / programs
* Optimization of finalized code
* Correction of documentation
* final presentation

TOTAL 12 ECTS = 360h
