# Orthogonal Codes for Acoustic Underwater Localization - Repository

This repository inhabits the following parts of the research project

- `latex` : source of research paper and final pdf files
- `matlab` : MATLAB scripts used at the beginning of the research, theoretically obsolete because of the switch to python, but still may be interesting
- `slides`: presentations made for the project as both pptx and pdf
